# Learn OpenGL
This repository contains my personal experiments and firest approch with openGL in c++.

## Goals

- Understand how the graphics pipeline works.
- Learn to use shaders
- Practice rendering in 2d and 3d
- Use matrix and vectors
> Basically learn how modern graphics computation works nowadays

## Steps
### Setup
1. Install GLFW
   GLFW is a library that will take of creating a window in the os we are currently using so we can focus more on opengl than creating the right window for our os.
   But i'll probably learn how to create my own window with the api of the os later for linux and windows.

> This is a learning project. Some folders may be unfinished or experimental.
